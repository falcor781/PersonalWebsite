<h3>Selected Projects and Roles</h3>
<ul>
  <li><u>(Feb 2007 - Aug 2007) Joint Coordinated Real-Time Engagement (Spiral 5)			Value: $400K	<b>Software Lead</b></u></li>
  Managed, implemented, and tested a web services-based data integration component that greatly improved the speed and maintainability of how the SOFTools application interacted with the JCRE system. Participated in daily meetings and testing events, working closely with other lead engineers, end customers, and management teams from several other companies to ensure deliverables were on-time and functioning properly. 
  <br/><br/>
  <li><u>(Aug 2006 - Feb 2007) Commander's Model Integration and Simulation Toolkit		Value: $300K	<b>Software Lead/Marketing</b></u></li>
  Architected Eclipse 3.2 plug-in for creating simulations using disparate modeling paradigms such as probabilistic modeling and system dynamics, and integrating and executing those simulations in parallel. Framework allows for defining new types of modeling entities independent of modeling tools (stored as Eclipse EMF models), provides APIs for transforming EMF model instances to instances native to a particular tool. New simulation instances are defined through a GUI generated using Eclipseâ€™s Graphical Editing Framework. Supported writing of new proposals and sought new markets to apply and extend this technology base.

  <li><u>(Oct 2003 - May 2005) <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=4f5b15ecdf8fe7b4e541e32aa3eccdaa&tab=core&_cview=0">Air Force Joint Air-Ground Unified Adaptive Replanning</a> 		Value: $1.5M	 <b>Software Staff</b></u></li>
  Key collaborator and developer of a Java framework to integrate various algorithms supporting a model-driven, domain-independent planning system that performs resource selection, routing, airspace deconfliction, and resource configuration. System is capable of automatically generating Air Tasking Orders to service hundreds of Air Force task objectives occurring simultaneously in the battle zone based on an externally generated world state estimate. Performed system-level debugging and extended functionality during incremental development and on-site testing using knowledge of software and algorithmic interactions of virtually every component in the system. Team expert of representation, integration, and extension of in-house Prolog knowledge base used to maintain and transform objects, object metadata, and constraints. Designed and implemented procedure for structuring a subset of OCL constraints as XML and transforming that data to our knowledge base via Prolog code generation implemented in XSLT. Designed JAXB-compliant XSD data model and implementation specifications for Option Selection, a greedy rollout algorithm that chooses which objectives could be satisfied based on consumable and reusable resource availability. Consultant for design and implementation of new case base structure, including auto-generation of Prolog rules which supported resource reservoir construction, and entity and activity generation; supported XSLT implementation to generate these rules.
  <br/><br/>

  Architected a system that interacted with existing standalone systems and a MySQL database, which combines planning and resource allocation to automatically discover workarounds to enemy-induced outages, such as destroyed bridges or electric generators, and produce repair schedules for these networked systems. Designed and implemented a novel forward chaining planning component based on the JSHOP and Bacchus/Ady planners capable of producing concurrent plans given tasks and operators defined in a hierarchical task network (HTN).
